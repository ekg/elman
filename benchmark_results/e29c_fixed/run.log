Results Summary
======================================================================
Model                     |   Params |     Loss |   Throughput
----------------------------------------------------------------------
mamba2_d1024_depth6       |    39.1M |   1.3194 | 230.3K tok/s
e1_d1024_depth6           |    31.7M |   2.5288 | 237.2K tok/s

======================================================================
Analysis: E29c vs E29a (should be similar throughput, E29c has 4*D more params)
======================================================================

E1 (baseline): loss=2.5288, 237.2K tok/s
  vs Mamba2: -1.2094 loss (better), 0.97x speed (slower)
  vs E29a: +0.9454 loss (worse), 0.13x speed (slower)
